# Welcome to the `uv-k5-firmware-custom` wiki!

On this wiki the (custom and extended) functions are described, which have been realized with this adapted firmware ([`releases`](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/releases)).

This firmware unlocks the full frequency range of the radio and expands the capabilities of the Quansheng UV-K5 (-serie).  
Original range 50 - 600 Mhz and now 18 MHz ~ 660 MHz and 840 ~ 1300 MHz. 
Note: _The RF BK4819, is the basis of the radio, has a hardware limitation (630 - 840 Mhz.)_.

Some of the other capabilities is the ability to receive in various modes (FM, AM and USB). 
The screen has an TX-audio signal strength indication and RX signal strength indication (S-meter) and the possibility to show channelname and frequentie of both VFO's. A detailed list of features can be found here [README.md](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom#readme).


* **Warning**: Modifying a radio may violate various laws or regulations of some nations. Not all of these capabilities will be allowed in order to comply with various regulations.
