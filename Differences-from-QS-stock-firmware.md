Not all original features are available in this firmware.

Because the size of the firmware is limited (60kB), not all functionalities may be available in the firmware. That is why a choice was made so that other functionality could be realized in the radio.
The menu has also been adjusted as a result. See [Menu](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/wiki/Menu) for a current description.

The most important differences compared to the original firmware are:

> ENABLE_AIRCOPY        := 0 
> 
> ENABLE_NOAA           := 0 
> 
> ENABLE_VOICE          := 0 
> 
> ENABLE_ALARM          := 0 
> 
> ENABLE_TX1750         := 0 
> 
> ENABLE_PWRON_PASSWORD := 0
