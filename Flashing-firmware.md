Flashing firmware is possible with a separate program, but can now be done much more easily from your web browser.

Just goto the page with official released [egzumer firmware releases](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/releases).

* First put the UV-K5 in programming mode (press `PTT` and turn on the UV-K5 and check that the WHITE LED lights up) and then connect the programming interface. Now a blue LED also lights up.

* Select the latest/desired firmware and look for 
 `ðŸ—²FLASH WITH A BROWSERðŸ—²`
and the build-in _UV-mod-programming-page_ start.
Just wait a moment and the firmware is loaded, or select a different file from your PC.
