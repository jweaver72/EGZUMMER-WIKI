Flashing firmware is possible with a separate program, but can now be done much more easily from your web browser.

Just goto the page with official released [egzumer firmware releases](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/releases)

Select the latest/desired firmware and look for 
 `ðŸ—²FLASH WITH A BROWSERðŸ—²`
and the build-in UV-mod programming-page start.
Just wait a moment and the firmware is loaded, or select a different file from your PC.

Select the Com-port where the programming-interface is connected.
