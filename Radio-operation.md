# Basic operation
Radio display is split into upper VFO and lower VFO. You can change upper/lower selection by pressing `F` + `2 A/B` (or by long press `2 A/B`).

Each VFO can independently of each other function in either frequency or channel mode. To switch modes select the desired VFO and press `F` + `3 VFO/MR` (or long press `3 VFO/MR`).

In the `frequency mode` you manually type in the frequency with keypad. You can also switch different options for that VFO in the menu (first 13 menu items VFO settings). If all settings are set the VFO can be saved to a memory channel by going into the menu `ChSave` and choosing the memory channel the VFO should be saved into.

In the `channel mode` you can switch between saved memory channels. Memory channels can be added manually as mentioned before or with a computer software. You can use either Quansheng `Portable Radio CPS` or open source software called `CHIRP` (recommended)
