Buttons have functions assigned to them, these functions can be activated by either pressing `F/#` button first, then the function button (I will call it `F+` call). Other method is by long pressing the function button alone without `F/#`. Most buttons replicate the `F+` with long press, but some buttons might have assigned different functions for `F+` and long press (for example button 5, * and Exit).
