Flashing firmware is possible with a separate program, but can now be done much more easily from your web browser.

Just goto the page with official released [egzumer firmware releases](https://github.com/egzumer/uv-k5-firmware-custom/releases).

* Use a Baofeng/Kenwood-like USB-2-Serial-cable with CH340-chip inside and connect it to your computer.

* Press the programming cable _firmly_ into the radio

* Switch of UV-K5

* Put the UV-K5 in programming mode (press `PTT` and turn on the UV-K5 and check that the flashlight lights up).

* Select the latest/desired firmware and look for 
 `ðŸ—²FLASH WITH A BROWSERðŸ—²`
and the build-in _UV-mod-programming-page_ start.
Just wait a moment and the firmware is loaded, or select a different file from your PC.
